# Demo Roguelike

This is a hobby project of mine to create a small roguelike from scratch. The technical targets that I set myself are:

  - First iteration runs on the console
  - Compiles for Windows and GNU/Linux
  - Second iteration runs with minimal dependencies (SDL2)
  - All code written without using third-party libraries
  - Small binary (before content is added, ideally less than 1mb)
